## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About app 
Super Schoolboy Remastered is a multiplication table trainer designed to alleviate and speed up the process of memorizing it, offering a number of useful functions, as well as a convenient, simple and intuitive interface.

Students' ignorance of the multiplication table, due to the lack of convenient, practical and easy-to-use tools for memorizing it, causes a number of quite serious problems for them, only some of them are: the waste of a lot of time and effort on ineffective methods of memorizing the multiplication table; in the future, starting from this point, students  experience difficulties with oral counting in lessons, exams, and in life in general; slowing down the process of their learning (at least due to increased time spent on oral counting); spending a lot of time and effort of their parents to help them in memorizing the multiplication table.
